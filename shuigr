    <h1>Hey! Welcome to my game!</h1>
    <h2>My name is Anna. I made this game for the honors project, and I'd love if you tried it out. Thanks!</h2>
    <p>There are three levels to the game. You'll be guided to a page if you click the Level One button, where you can play the game. The rules are, gain enough points in enough time, and you move on! Controls are arrow keys. You gain points by interacting with NPC humans. However, interacting with certain humans can cause you to lose points, so be careful! </p>
<h3> This game is meant to represent the evolution of the junco bird. If you don't remember, we learned about the junco bird, a bird that evolved to be more social. To reflect that, the more interaction you have with humans, the more points you get. You only advance if you get enough points, signifying how birds without those social skills didn't survive.
